# Multi-AI Agents Q&A Chatbot

This project implements a **Q&A chatbot** powered by **Multi-AI Agents** using the **LangGraph** framework. The goal of this chatbot is to efficiently handle user queries by fetching information from external resources, such as **Tavily Search** and **Wikipedia**, and providing context-aware and accurate responses.

## How It Works

- **Parallelized AI Agents:** The system uses multiple agents working in parallel to retrieve information from different data sources when a query is submitted.
- **Web & Wikipedia Search Integration:** The chatbot integrates with **Tavily Search** and **Wikipedia** to gather real-time, up-to-date information, ensuring the responses are relevant and comprehensive.
- **Contextual Answer Generation:** Using LangGraphâ€™s state management, the chatbot processes the gathered information and generates contextually accurate responses.

## Technologies Used

- **LangGraph**: For managing AI agent workflows and state management.
- **Tavily Search**: For retrieving real-time search results from the web.
- **Wikipedia API**: For fetching relevant documents from Wikipedia.
- **ChatGroq**: For AI-driven response generation.

## Key Features

- Parallelized processing using multiple AI agents.
- Integration with external resources for up-to-date data.
- Contextually accurate responses based on user queries and retrieved information.

## Future Improvements

This project highlights the potential of combining multiple AI agents and external data sources to create more intelligent, context-aware systems. Future improvements include adding more external data integrations and enhancing the AI's ability to handle complex queries.
